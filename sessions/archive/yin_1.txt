Now bring the soles of your feet together in front of you, allowing your knees to fall apart into Butterfly pose. Hold onto your feet or ankles, whatever feels comfortable. Begin to fold forward from your hips, letting your spine round naturally. There's no need to force anything here—just allow gravity to gently draw you forward. Rest your forehead on your hands, on a block, or use a bolster for support if you have one available.

You should feel a gentle opening along your inner thighs and groins. Maybe some sensation in your lower back as well. This is like a slow, warm melting. Breathe into any areas of tightness, and with each exhale, see if you can soften just a little bit more. There's nowhere to go, nothing to achieve—just be here with whatever sensations arise.

<hold 3 minutes>

Slowly begin to roll up, vertebra by vertebra. Straighten your legs out in front of you and shake them gently. Now we're going to work each side individually. Extend your right leg straight and bring your left heel in toward your right inner thigh. Sit tall for a moment, then begin to fold forward over your extended right leg. Let your spine round, let your hands rest wherever they naturally fall—on your leg, on the floor, on props.

Feel the stretch along the back of your right leg, through your hamstring. You might also feel opening in your left hip flexor and along the right side of your lower back. Each side of our body is different, so just notice what your right side is offering you today without judgment.

<hold 2 minutes>

Come up slowly and switch sides. Extend your left leg straight, bring your right heel toward your left inner thigh. Again, sit tall first, then fold forward over your left leg. Notice how this side feels different from the right—maybe tighter, maybe more open. There's no right or wrong here, just curiosity about what your body is experiencing.

You're feeling that same hamstring stretch now on the left side, opening through the right hip flexor, sensation along the left side of your lower back. Keep breathing deeply, allowing your breath to massage you from the inside.

<hold 2 minutes>

Come up and extend both legs straight in front of you. Now open your legs wide—not as wide as possible, but to a comfortable width where you can still sit tall. Place your hands in front of you and begin to walk them forward, slowly folding between your legs. Let your spine round completely, rest your forehead on your hands, on a block, or on the floor if you can reach it comfortably.

This is a deep release for your inner thighs, your adductors, and you might feel a gentle traction through your entire spine. Some of you might also feel this in your hamstrings. Breathe into the sensations, and remember that in yin yoga, we're not trying to go deeper—we're trying to stay present with whatever depth we've found.

<hold 4 minutes>

Slowly walk your hands back toward you and sit up. Bring your knees together and give them a gentle hug. We're going to transition now to lying down for some deeper hip work. Come onto your back and hug your knees into your chest for a moment. Feel your lower back lengthen and release against the earth.

<hold 1 minute>

Place your feet on the floor with your knees bent. Now bring your right ankle to rest on your left thigh, just above the knee, creating a figure-four shape with your legs. Thread your hands behind your left thigh and gently draw your legs toward your chest. This is our seated figure-four, but lying down.

You should feel a deep stretch in your right glute and possibly along the right side of your hip. If this feels too intense, you can keep your left foot on the floor instead of drawing the leg in. Use a strap around your thigh if you can't reach comfortably. This is often quite intense, so breathe deeply and back off if you need to.

<hold 3 minutes>

Release and switch sides. Left ankle comes to your right thigh, thread your hands behind your right thigh, and draw everything in toward you. Again, notice how this side feels different. One side is often much tighter than the other—this is completely normal.

Feel that same deep glute stretch now on the left side. Keep your shoulders relaxed, keep breathing. If your arms get tired, you can use a strap or just hold wherever is comfortable.

<hold 3 minutes>

Release both legs and hug your knees in toward your chest again. Rock gently side to side, massaging your lower back. Now we're going to do a gentle reclined twist. Keep your knees bent and drop both knees over to your right side. You can place a bolster or pillow between your knees if that feels more supportive. Extend your arms out to the sides in a T-shape.

Feel this gentle release through your spine and lower back. You might feel the twist along the left side of your torso as well. Turn your head to the left if that feels comfortable for your neck. This should feel relieving after all the hip work we've been doing.

<hold 3 minutes>

Slowly bring your knees back to center, then drop them over to the left side. Arms stay in that T-shape, and you can turn your head to the right if you'd like. Feel the twist from the opposite direction now, helping to balance your spine and release any lingering tension from our hip opening.

<hold 2 minutes>

Come back to center and hug your knees in once more. Now we're going to do one more hip opener lying down. Bring both knees wide apart and draw the soles of your feet together, creating a diamond shape with your legs. Let your knees fall toward the floor—you can place blocks or pillows under your knees for support if they don't reach the ground comfortably. Rest your hands on your belly or by your sides.

This is like our opening Butterfly pose, but lying down, which allows gravity to work in a different way. Feel the gentle opening through your inner thighs and groins. Your hip flexors might be releasing here as well. This should feel restorative and opening after all our work.

<hold 4 minutes>

Slowly bring your knees together and extend your legs long for our final Savasana. Let your feet fall apart naturally, arms rest by your sides with palms facing up. Close your eyes and allow your entire body to completely relax and integrate all the work you've done today.

Feel the sense of ease and spaciousness through your hips and lower back. Notice how your body feels different from when we started. Your nervous system is shifting from doing to being, from effort to ease. There's nothing more you need to do right now except rest and receive the benefits of your practice.

The effects of yin yoga continue to unfold for hours after we practice, so be gentle with yourself as you move through the rest of your day. Rest here for as long as you need.

<hold 4 minutes>

When you're ready, begin to wiggle your fingers and toes. Take a few deeper breaths, feeling your body returning to more alertness. Roll gently to one side and rest there for a moment before slowly pressing yourself up to sitting.

Take a moment in stillness to notice how you feel. Thank yourself for dedicating this hour to caring for your body and nervous system. The work you've done here today will continue to benefit you long after you leave your mat.
