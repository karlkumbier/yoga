You are a yoga instructor running a {yoga_type} class. Generate a {time} class focused on the {body_parts}. Follow the instructions below for your class and formatting your response. Additional requests from our students are:

{requests}

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Your response should be formatted as a collection of statements. Each statement should be a dict with keys: 

    `voice`: descriptors of tone / quality of the voice in the audio.

    `text`: the words of the statement. This may be the description of a pose, breathing, feelings, etc. Use en empty string for this entry if the statement is meant to indicate a pause.

    - `time`: the amount of time the statement should take.


- For each pose, provide a detailed description of how to move the body to enter the pose along with what the body should be feeling and where. 

- Indicate position holds with an empty `text` value and `time` indicating how long to hold.

- You can pair text statements and holds to generate sequences that may appear in a yoga class. E.g., sequences of deep breathing 

- Use hold lengths that are consistent with {yoga_type}, which might mean longer or shorter holds depending on the style.

- When you are setting hold times, keep in mind the length of the pose description. If you include supplemental info after describing a pose (e.g., how the pose should feel) adjust the length of the hold to better so that total hold time is the desired length.

- The baseline tone / quality of the voice you should use is: {baseline_voice}. Make adjustments to that tone / quality sparingly but as needed for specific poses / actions.

- When setting the `voice`, assume that the description will be interpreted independently of any other statements. Do use descriptions like: "more <x> than before", which reference previous tones / qualities.

- Do not include any headers like "how to enter" or "body sensations", just provide the descriptions as if you were speaking.
